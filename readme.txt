Collect e-mail addresses from users with a simple form. Send them an e-mail automagically.

== Description ==

This plugin can be used to send e-mail to users wanting specific information. The front side of the 'WP Opt-in' plugin is a simple form with an e-mail input field and a submit button. By entering an e-mail address into the field and pressing submit, an e-mail is sent automatically to the specified address.

The contents and sender of the automatic e-mail can be specified in options, along with whatever you would like for status messages and other text for the front side.

IP address and time for submit is stored together with the e-mail address in the database. E-mail entries in the database can be selectively deleted. Export to a Bcc friendly format is also possible.

== Installation ==

1. Download and unzip the plugin
2. Upload `wp-opt-in.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Place the widget in your sidebar and edit its title
5. Configure the plugin in the 'WP Opt-in' menu located under the WordPress 'Options' menu

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I send e-mail to all users who have asked for information through this plugin? =

Yes. Simply copy all the e-mail addresses from the 'Bcc friendly format' section on the plugin options page. Paste them into the Bcc field in your favorite e-mail client software.

= What does Bcc mean? =

Blind carbon copy. A receipient field for e-mail. Using it results in not revealing e-mail addresses between the recipients.

= Can spammers use this to get me in trouble? =

Subject, sender and contents of the e-mail sent from this plugin is controlled by the plugin and you. There should be no reason for sending someone this information unless they asked for it.

= What about security? =

The input e-mail address is checked for suspicious characters before it's used.
